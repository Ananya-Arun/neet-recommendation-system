# NEET Student Recommendation System
A Python-based student performance analysis and NEET rank prediction system.

## Overview
This project analyzes quiz performance data to provide personalized recommendations for NEET aspirants. It highlights weak areas, tracks improvement trends, and suggests strategies to enhance preparation. Additionally, it predicts a student's probable NEET rank based on historical quiz data.

## Features
- **Performance Analysis**: Tracks accuracy by topic and difficulty level.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Suggests improvement strategies based on weak areas.
- **Student Persona Analysis**: Categorizes students based on their learning patterns.
- **NEET Rank Prediction**: Uses a logistic regression model to estimate the probable NEET rank.

## Dataset
- **Fixed_Quiz_Submission_Data.json**: Latest quiz submissions, including questions, topics, and responses.
- **Fixed_Current_Quiz_Data.json**: Current quiz data with question details and student answers.
- **Fixed_Historical_Quiz_Data.json**: Past 5 quiz performances, including scores and selected answers.
