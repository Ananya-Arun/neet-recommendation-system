They receive nutrients from the underlying connective tissue through diffusion.\\n\\n**Functions of Epithelial Tissue:**\\n\\n* **Protection:** Forms a physical barrier against pathogens, chemicals, and physical damage.\\n* **Secretion:** Secretes various substances, such as mucus, enzymes, and hormones.\\n* **Absorption:** Facilitates the uptake of substances from the external environment or body fluids.\\n* **Excretion:** Helps eliminate waste products from the body.\\n* **Sensory:** Contains specialized cells that detect changes in the environment and transmit sensory information.\\n\\n**Additional Context:**\\n\\nEpithelial tissue is classified into different types based on its structure and function. Some of the common types include:\\n\\n* **Simple Epithelium:** Consists of a single layer of cells.\\n* **Stratified Epithelium:** Consists of multiple layers of cells.\\n* **Glandular Epithelium:** Specialized for secretion of substances.\\n* **Sensory Epithelium:** Contains specialized sensory cells.\",\n","        \"type\": \"\",\n","        \"is_mandatory\": false,\n","        \"show_in_feed\": false,\n","        \"pyq_label\": null,\n","        \"topic_id\": 146,\n","        \"reading_material_id\": 2016,\n","        \"fixed_at\": null,\n","        \"fix_summary\": null,\n","        \"created_by\": null,\n","        \"updated_by\": null,\n","        \"quiz_level\": null,\n","        \"question_from\": \"Q-bank\",\n","        \"language\": null,\n","        \"photo_url\": null,\n","        \"photo_solution_url\": null,\n","        \"is_saved\": false,\n","        \"tag\": \"\",\n","        \"options\": [\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7321,\n","            \"description\": \"Muscular tissue\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1827,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T12:43:34.365+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T12:43:34.365+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7322,\n","            \"description\": \"Fluid connective tissue\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1827,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T12:43:34.369+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T12:43:34.369+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7323,\n","            \"description\": \"Epithelial tissue\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1827,\n","            \"is_correct\": true,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T12:43:34.372+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T12:43:34.372+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7324,\n","            \"description\": \"Nervous tissue\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1827,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T12:43:34.376+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T12:43:34.376+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          }\n","        ]\n","      },\n","      {\n","        \"id\": 1828,\n","        \"description\": \"Epithelial tissue is distinguished from connective tissue, muscular, or nervous tissue by its\",\n","        \"difficulty_level\": null,\n","        \"topic\": \"structural organisation in animals \",\n","        \"is_published\": true,\n","        \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T12:50:56.100+05:30\",\n","        \"updated_at\": \"2024-11-30T18:39:20.788+05:30\",\n","        \"detailed_solution\": \"**Epithelial Tissue**\\n\\n* Epithelial tissue is a continuous sheet of cells that covers the body and lines its internal cavities.\\n* It serves as a barrier between the internal environment of the body and the external environment.\\n\\n**Distinguishing Features of Epithelial Tissue**\\n\\nEpithelial tissue is distinguished from connective tissue, muscular tissue, and nervous tissue by its:\\n\\n**1.

Cells can exchange nutrients, ions, and other molecules directly with their neighbors through these junctions.\\n\\nb) **Tight junctions prevent the leakage of materials between the cells:** Tight junctions are specialized cell junctions that create a tight seal between adjacent cells. This prevents the uncontrolled movement of substances between the cells, maintaining the integrity of the tissues and organs.\\n\\nc) **Gap junctions provide channels for direct cytoplasmic connections between adjacent cells:** Gap junctions are another type of cell junction that forms direct channels between the cytoplasm of adjacent cells. These channels allow the rapid exchange of ions, nutrients, and small molecules, facilitating cell-to-cell communication and the coordination of cellular activities.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer \\\"All of the above\\\" is correct because all three statements accurately describe the functions of cell junctions in multicellular organisms.\",\n","        \"type\": \"\",\n","        \"is_mandatory\": false,\n","        \"show_in_feed\": false,\n","        \"pyq_label\": null,\n","        \"topic_id\": 146,\n","        \"reading_material_id\": 2026,\n","        \"fixed_at\": null,\n","        \"fix_summary\": null,\n","        \"created_by\": null,\n","        \"updated_by\": null,\n","        \"quiz_level\": null,\n","        \"question_from\": \"Q-bank\",\n","        \"language\": null,\n","        \"photo_url\": null,\n","        \"photo_solution_url\": null,\n","        \"is_saved\": false,\n","        \"tag\": \"\",\n","        \"options\": [\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7361,\n","            \"description\": \"Tight junctions help to stop substances from leaking across a tissue.\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1837,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T13:21:54.614+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T13:21:54.614+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7362,\n","            \"description\": \"Adhering junctions perform cementing to keen neighbouring cells together.\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1837,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T13:21:54.616+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T13:21:54.616+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7363,\n","            \"description\": \"All of the above\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1837,\n","            \"is_correct\": true,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T13:21:54.618+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-03T16:51:16.545+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7364,\n","            \"description\": \"Gap junctions facilitate the cells to communicate With each other by connecting the cytoplasm adjoining cells, for rapid transfer of ions small molecules and sometimes big molecules\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1837,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T13:21:54.619+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-03T16:51:16.542+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          }\n","        ]\n","      },\n","      {\n","        \"id\": 1838,\n","        \"description\": \"Choose the correctly matched pair\",\n","        \"difficulty_level\": null,\n","        \"topic\": \"structural organisation in animals \",\n","        \"is_published\": true,\n","        \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T13:43:37.422+05:30\",\n","        \"updated_at\": \"2024-11-30T18:39:22.828+05:30\",\n","        \"detailed_solution\": \"**Explanation:**\\n\\nThe tubular parts of nephrons are lined by cuboidal epithelium.

They are composed of channels that span the plasma membranes of adjacent cells, creating a cytoplasmic bridge between them.

They allow the exchange of ions, nutrients, and other molecules between cells, which is essential for coordinated tissue function. Gap junctions also play a role in electrical signalling, allowing the spread of electrical impulses between cells.\\n\\n**Additional Context on Gap Junctions:**\\n\\n* Gap junctions are found in a wide variety of tissues, including cardiac muscle, smooth muscle, and the nervous system.\\n* They are essential for the synchronous contraction of cardiac muscle cells, the coordinated activity of smooth muscle cells, and the rapid transmission of nerve impulses.\\n* Gap junction formation is regulated by a variety of factors, including hormonal signals and cell-cell interactions.\\n* Disruption of gap junction function can lead to a variety of diseases, such as heart arrhythmias and neurological disorders.\",\n","        \"type\": \"\",\n","        \"is_mandatory\": false,\n","        \"show_in_feed\": false,\n","        \"pyq_label\": null,\n","        \"topic_id\": 146,\n","        \"reading_material_id\": 2028,\n","        \"fixed_at\": null,\n","        \"fix_summary\": null,\n","        \"created_by\": null,\n","        \"updated_by\": null,\n","        \"quiz_level\": null,\n","        \"question_from\": \"Q-bank\",\n","        \"language\": null,\n","        \"photo_url\": null,\n","        \"photo_solution_url\": null,\n","        \"is_saved\": false,\n","        \"tag\": \"\",\n","        \"options\": [\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7369,\n","            \"description\": \"separate two cells from each other\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1839,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T13:46:13.194+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T13:46:13.194+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7370,\n","            \"description\": \"stop substance from leaking across a tissue\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1839,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T13:46:13.198+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T13:46:13.198+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7371,\n","            \"description\": \"performing cementing to keep neighbouring cells together\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1839,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T13:46:13.202+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T13:46:13.202+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7372,\n","            \"description\": \"facilitate communication between adjoining cells by connecting the cytoplasm for rapid transfer of ions, small molecules and some large molecules\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1839,\n","            \"is_correct\": true,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T13:46:13.206+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T13:46:13.206+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          }\n","        ]\n","      },\n","      {\n","        \"id\": 1840,\n","        \"description\": \"The only type of cell seen in a tendon is\",\n","        \"difficulty_level\": null,\n","        \"topic\": \"structural organisation in animals \",\n","        \"is_published\": true,\n","        \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T13:47:38.668+05:30\",\n","        \"updated_at\": \"2024-11-30T18:39:23.241+05:30\",\n","        \"detailed_solution\": \"**Explanation:**\\n\\nTendons are fibrous connective tissues that attach muscles to bones.

Cartilage is a type of connective tissue that is found throughout the body. It is composed of specialized cells called chondrocytes, which are embedded in a matrix of collagen and other proteins.\\n\\nCartilage is a strong and flexible tissue that provides support and protection to the body. It is also found in the joints, where it helps to reduce friction and wear. Cartilage is not as hard as bone, but it is more flexible and elastic. This makes it ideal for use in areas where flexibility is important.\\n\\nHere is a more detailed explanation of the role of cartilage in the human external ears and nose tip:\\n\\n* **External ears:** The external ears are made up of a thin layer of skin that is supported by a framework of cartilage. This cartilage gives the external ears their shape and allows them to move.\\n* **Nose tip:** The nose tip is also made up of a thin layer of skin that is supported by a framework of cartilage. This cartilage gives the nose tip its shape and allows it to move.\\n\\nCartilage is an important tissue that plays a vital role in the structure and function of the human body. It is a strong and flexible tissue that provides support, protection, and flexibility.\\n\\n**Additional context:**\\n\\n* Cartilage is classified into three types: hyaline cartilage, elastic cartilage, and fibrocartilage.\\n* Hyaline cartilage is the most common type of cartilage. It is found in the joints, nose tip, and external ears.\\n* Elastic cartilage is found in the ears and epiglottis.

Gap junctions are present in various tissues, including the heart, brain, and liver, where intercellular communication is crucial.\\n\\n**Additional context:**\\n\\n* Gap junctions are typically 8-10 nm wide and are formed by the docking of two connexons, each consisting of six connexin proteins.\\n* Connexons align to form a central pore that allows the passage of small molecules (up to 1.2 kDa).\\n* Gap junctions can be regulated by various factors, including voltage, calcium concentration, and phosphorylation, which can alter their permeability and communication efficiency.\",\n","        \"type\": \"\",\n","        \"is_mandatory\": false,\n","        \"show_in_feed\": false,\n","        \"pyq_label\": null,\n","        \"topic_id\": 146,\n","        \"reading_material_id\": 2040,\n","        \"fixed_at\": null,\n","        \"fix_summary\": null,\n","        \"created_by\": null,\n","        \"updated_by\": null,\n","        \"quiz_level\": null,\n","        \"question_from\": \"Q-bank\",\n","        \"language\": null,\n","        \"photo_url\": null,\n","        \"photo_solution_url\": null,\n","        \"is_saved\": false,\n","        \"tag\": \"\",\n","        \"options\": [\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7417,\n","            \"description\": \"separate two cells from each other\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1851,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T14:13:15.533+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T14:13:15.533+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7418,\n","            \"description\": \"stop substance from leaking across a tissue.\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1851,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T14:13:15.537+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T14:13:15.537+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7419,\n","            \"description\": \"performing cementing to keep neighbouring cells together\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1851,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T14:13:15.540+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T14:13:15.540+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7420,\n","            \"description\": \"facilitate communication between adjoining cells by connecting the cytoplasm for rapid transfer of ions, small molecules and some large molecules\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1851,\n","            \"is_correct\": true,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T14:13:15.543+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T14:13:15.543+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          }\n","        ]\n","      },\n","      {\n","        \"id\": 1852,\n","        \"description\": \"Choose the correctly matched pair.\",\n","        \"difficulty_level\": null,\n","        \"topic\": \"structural organisation in animals \",\n","        \"is_published\": true,\n","        \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T14:14:40.254+05:30\",\n","        \"updated_at\": \"2024-11-30T18:39:25.738+05:30\",\n","        \"detailed_solution\": \"**Explanation:**\\n\\nAreolar tissue is a type of loose connective tissue that is widely distributed throughout the body. It is characterized by its loose arrangement of cells and fibers, and its ability to change its shape easily.

It also contains blood vessels and nerves that supply the tissues with nutrients and oxygen.\\n\\n**Additional context:**\\n\\n* Loose connective tissue is a type of connective tissue that is characterized by its loose arrangement of cells and fibers. It is found in many parts of the body, including the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and around organs.\\n* Loose connective tissue is made up of three main components: cells, fibers, and ground substance. The cells are typically fibroblasts, which are responsible for producing the fibers and ground substance. The fibers are made of collagen and elastin, which provide strength and elasticity to the tissue. The ground substance is a gel-like substance that fills the spaces between the cells and fibers.\\n* Loose connective tissue has a variety of functions, including:\\n    * Providing support and cushioning for the surrounding tissues\\n    * Transporting nutrients and oxygen to the tissues\\n    * Removing waste products from the tissues\\n    * Providing a reservoir of stem cells that can differentiate into other types of cells\",\n","        \"type\": \"\",\n","        \"is_mandatory\": false,\n","        \"show_in_feed\": false,\n","        \"pyq_label\": null,\n","        \"topic_id\": 146,\n","        \"reading_material_id\": 2041,\n","        \"fixed_at\": null,\n","        \"fix_summary\": null,\n","        \"created_by\": null,\n","        \"updated_by\": null,\n","        \"quiz_level\": null,\n","        \"question_from\": \"Q-bank\",\n","        \"language\": null,\n","        \"photo_url\": null,\n","        \"photo_solution_url\": null,\n","        \"is_saved\": false,\n","        \"tag\": \"\",\n","        \"options\": [\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7421,\n","            \"description\": \"Tendon-Specialized connective tissue\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1852,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T14:14:40.262+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T14:14:40.262+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7422,\n","            \"description\": \"Adipose tissue -

Gap junctions allow for the electrical coupling of adjacent cells, while desmosomes and fascia adherens provide mechanical support and prevent the cells from pulling apart.\\n* **Function:** The main function of intercalated discs is to allow for the rapid and coordinated contraction of the heart. When an electrical impulse reaches a cardiac muscle cell, it travels through the intercalated discs to adjacent cells. This causes all of the cells in the heart to contract at the same time, which pumps blood out of the heart and into the body.\\n\\n**Additional context:**\\n\\n* Intercalated discs are only found in cardiac muscle cells.\\n* The structure of intercalated discs is unique to cardiac muscle cells and is essential for the proper function of the heart.\\n* Intercalated discs are a target for a number of drugs, including calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers. These drugs can affect the function of intercalated discs and can therefore be used to treat a variety of heart conditions.\",\n","        \"type\": \"\",\n","        \"is_mandatory\": false,\n","        \"show_in_feed\": false,\n","        \"pyq_label\": null,\n","        \"topic_id\": 146,\n","        \"reading_material_id\": 2044,\n","        \"fixed_at\": null,\n","        \"fix_summary\": null,\n","        \"created_by\": null,\n","        \"updated_by\": null,\n","        \"quiz_level\": null,\n","        \"question_from\": \"Q-bank\",\n","        \"language\": null,\n","        \"photo_url\": null,\n","        \"photo_solution_url\": null,\n","        \"is_saved\": false,\n","        \"tag\": \"\",\n","        \"options\": [\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7433,\n","            \"description\": \"cardiac muscles\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1855,\n","            \"is_correct\": true,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T14:19:04.796+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T14:19:04.796+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7434,\n","            \"description\": \"striped muscles\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1855,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T14:19:04.804+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T14:19:04.804+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7435,\n","            \"description\": \"adipose tissue\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1855,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T14:19:04.809+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T14:19:04.809+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7436,\n","            \"description\": \"nerve and striated muscles\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1855,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T14:19:04.811+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T14:19:04.811+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          }\n","        ]\n","      },\n","      {\n","        \"id\": 1856,\n","        \"description\": \"Smooth muscles are _______.\",\n","        \"difficulty_level\": null,\n","        \"topic\": \"structural organisation in animals \",\n","        \"is_published\": true,\n","        \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T14:23:22.049+05:30\",\n","        \"updated_at\": \"2024-11-30T18:39:26.576+05:30\",\n","        \"detailed_solution\": \"**Explanation:**\\n\\nSmooth muscles are involuntary muscles, meaning they are not under conscious control.

the axons of neurons, which speeds up the transmission of electrical impulses.\\n* **Phagocytosis:** Microglial cells act as phagocytes, removing damaged or dead neurons and debris from the nervous

nervous system. The unit of neural tissue is the neuron, which is a specialized cell that is capable of transmitting electrical signals throughout the body. Chondrocytes, on the other hand, are cells that make up cartilage, which is a type of connective tissue. Chondrocytes are not excitable cells, and they do not play a role in the transmission of electrical signals.\\n\\nHere is a breakdown of the other statements in the question:\\n\\n**A). Neurons are the structural and functional unit of the nervous system**\\n- This is true. Neurons are the basic building blocks of the nervous system, and they are responsible for transmitting electrical signals throughout the body.\\n**B). Neuroglia provide structural and nutritional support to the neurons**\\n- This is also true. Neuroglia are cells that provide support and protection to the neurons. They help to keep the neurons in place, and they also provide them with nutrients and oxygen.\\n**C). Nervous tissue is found only in the brain and spinal cord**\\n- This is not true. Nervous tissue is found throughout the body, including in the peripheral nerves, which are responsible for transmitting signals to and from the brain and spinal cord.\",\n","        \"type\":

Mast cells are important for the body's immune response, as they release histamine and other inflammatory mediators when they are activated.\\n\\nHere are some additional details about mast cells and areolar connective tissue:\\n\\n* Mast cells are derived from stem cells in the bone marrow. They circulate in the blood and then migrate to tissues where they are needed.\\n* Areolar connective tissue is a type of loose connective tissue that is characterized by its loose, irregular arrangement of collagen fibers. It is found in many parts of the body, such as the dermis of the skin, the submucosa of the digestive tract, and the stroma of organs.\\n* Mast cells are activated by a variety of stimuli, including allergens, cytokines, and physical trauma. When they are activated, they release histamine and other inflammatory mediators, which cause blood vessels to dilate and become more permeable. This leads to increased blood flow and the accumulation of fluid and white blood cells in the affected area.\\n* Mast cells play an important role in the body's immune response. They are involved in both innate immunity and adaptive immunity. In innate immunity, mast cells release histamine and other inflammatory mediators that help to recruit other immune cells to the site of infection. In adaptive immunity, mast cells present antigens to T cells, which helps to activate the adaptive immune response.\\n\\nOverall, mast cells are important cells that play a key role in the body's immune response.

It is divided into two main branches:\\n\\n* **Gross anatomy** - studies the structure of organs and body systems as seen with the naked eye\\n* **Microscopic anatomy** - studies the structure of cells and tissues using microscopes\\n\\nThe study of the morphology of internal organs in animals falls under the branch of gross anatomy. It involves examining the shape, size, and arrangement of organs within the body. This knowledge is essential for understanding how the body functions and how diseases can affect it.\\n\\n**Additional context:**\\n\\n* Anatomy is often divided into several subspecialties, including:\\n    * **Human anatomy** - the study of the structure of the human body\\n    * **Comparative anatomy** - the study of the structure of different animal species\\n    * **Developmental anatomy** - the study of how the body develops from an embryo to an adult\\n    * **Pathological anatomy** - the study of how diseases affect the body's structure\\n* Anatomy is closely related to physiology, which studies the function of living things. Together, anatomy and physiology provide a comprehensive understanding of how our bodies work.\",\n","        \"type\": \"\",\n","        \"is_mandatory\": false,\n","        \"show_in_feed\": false,\n","        \"pyq_label\": null,\n","        \"topic_id\": 146,\n","        \"reading_material_id\": 2056,\n","        \"fixed_at\": null,\n","        \"fix_summary\": null,\n","        \"created_by\": null,\n","        \"updated_by\": null,\n","        \"quiz_level\": null,\n","        \"question_from\": \"Q-bank\",\n","        \"language\": null,\n","        \"photo_url\": null,\n","        \"photo_solution_url\": null,\n","        \"is_saved\": false,\n","        \"tag\": \"\",\n","        \"options\": [\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7481,\n","            \"description\": \"Study of form or externally visible features\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1867,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T14:56:41.716+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T14:56:41.716+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7482,\n","            \"description\": \"Study of internal as well as external features.\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1867,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T14:56:41.722+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T14:56:41.722+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7483,\n","            \"description\": \"Study of morphology of internal organs in the animal\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1867,\n","            \"is_correct\": true,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T14:56:41.725+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T14:56:41.725+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7484,\n","            \"description\": \"None of the above statements\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1867,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T14:56:41.728+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T14:56:41.728+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          }\n","        ]\n","      },\n","      {\n","        \"id\": 1868,\n","        \"description\": \"General function of gland is to\",\n","        \"difficulty_level\": null,\n","        \"topic\": \"structural organisation in animals \",\n","        \"is_published\": true,\n","        \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T15:04:19.702+05:30\",\n","        \"updated_at\": \"2024-11-30T18:39:29.056+05:30\",\n","        \"detailed_solution\": \"**Explanation:**\\n\\nGlands are specialized structures in animals that produce and secrete chemicals known as hormones, enzymes, or other substances.

allows air to enter the lungs directly, bypassing the nose and mouth.\\n* As a result, the frog can still breathe and will not die.\\n\\n**Additional Context:**\\n\\n* Frogs have three main modes of respiration: cutaneous (through the skin), buccal (through the buccal cavity), and pulmonary (through the lungs).\\n* Pulmonary respiration is the most efficient and is the primary mode of respiration in adult frogs.\\n* The lungs are located in the thoracic cavity and are lined by capillaries that allow for the exchange of gases.\",\n","        \"type\": \"\",\n","        \"is_mandatory\":

electrical impulses on its own, without external stimulation.\\n* The generation of electrical impulses in the heart is regulated by a special group of cells called the sinoatrial node (SA node), which acts as the natural pacemaker of the heart.\\n\\n**3-Chambered Heart:**\\n\\n* The frog's heart consists of three chambers:\\n    * Two atria (right and left)\\n    * One ventricle\\n\\n**Additional Context:**\\n\\n* The frog's heart is a double circulatory system, meaning blood passes through the heart twice in one complete circuit of the body.\\n* The first circuit carries deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs for gas exchange, and the second circuit carries oxygenated blood from the lungs to the rest of the body.\\n* The heart receives deoxygenated blood from the body through the right atrium and pumps it to the lungs through the pulmonary artery.\\n* After gas exchange in the lungs, oxygenated blood returns to the heart through the left atrium and is pumped to the rest of the body through the aorta.\\n* The ventricle of the frog's heart is muscular and responsible for pumping blood to the lungs and the body.\\n* The atria are thinner-walled

It is characterized by the presence of numerous microvilli, which are small finger-like protrusions. These microvilli increase the surface area of the epithelium, which allows for the efficient absorption of nutrients from the digested food.\\n\\nThe small intestine is the primary site of nutrient absorption in the human body. It is divided into three regions: the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. The brush border epithelium is present in all three regions, but it is most prominent in the jejunum and ileum.\\n\\nThe brush border epithelium is composed of a single layer of tall columnar cells. The cells are connected by tight junctions, which prevent the passage of materials between the cells. The apical surface of the cells is covered in microvilli. The microvilli are lined with glycoproteins, which provide a sticky surface for the absorption of nutrients.\\n\\nThe brush border epithelium also contains a number of goblet cells, which secrete mucus. The mucus helps to protect the epithelium from damage by digestive enzymes.\\n\\n**Additional Context:**\\n\\n* The brush border epithelium is also found in the proximal convoluted tubules of the kidney.\\n* The brush border epithelium is a highly dynamic structure that is constantly being renewed. The cells of the epithelium are shed every few days and replaced by new cells.\\n* The brush border epithelium is essential for the absorption of nutrients from the small intestine.

It is characterized by its close-fitting, tightly packed cells and its ability to divide and regenerate throughout life.\\n\\n**Reasons why Epithelial Tissue has Power of Division and Regeneration:**\\n\\n* **Basal Cells:** Epithelial tissue typically contains a layer of basal cells at its base. These basal cells are actively dividing and producing new cells.\\n* **Stem Cells:** Epithelial tissue often contains stem cells, which are unspecialized cells that can differentiate into different types of specialized cells. These stem cells contribute to the tissue's ability to regenerate and repair itself.\\n* **Rapid Turnover:** Epithelial cells are constantly exposed to wear and tear, so they need to be replaced regularly. The rapid turnover of epithelial cells allows the tissue to maintain its integrity and function.\\n\\n**Examples of Epithelial Tissue Regeneration:**\\n\\n* Skin: Skin cells are constantly dividing and replacing damaged or dead cells. This process keeps the skin healthy and protected.\\n* Digestive Tract: The epithelial lining of the digestive tract is constantly renewed to protect against digestive enzymes and other harsh chemicals.\\n* Respiratory Tract: The epithelial lining of the respiratory tract traps foreign particles and protects the lungs. It regenerates regularly to maintain its protective function.\\n\\n**Importance of Epithelial Tissue Regeneration:**\\n\\nThe ability of epithelial tissue to divide and regenerate is essential for maintaining the health and function of the body. It allows for:\\n\\n* Tissue repair after injury\\n* Replacement of worn-out or damaged cells\\n* Protection against infection and environmental factors\\n\\n**Additional Context:**\\n\\nEpithelial tissue is classified into different types based on its structure and function:\\n\\n* **Simple Epithelium:** Composed of a single layer of cells.\\n* **Stratified Epithelium:** Composed of multiple layers of cells.\\n* **Glandular Epithelium:** Secretes substances into the body.\\n\\nEpithelial tissue also plays a role in absorption, secretion, protection, and sensation. Understanding the structure and function of epithelial tissue is crucial for comprehending the biology of animals.\",\n","        \"type\": null,\n","        \"is_mandatory\": false,\n","

Multilayer of cells**\\n\\nCompound epithelia are classified based on the shape and arrangement of cells in different layers. They are typically multilayer, meaning they have more than one layer of cells. The cells in compound epithelia can be of different shapes, such as squamous, cuboidal, or columnar, and can be arranged in various ways.\\n\\nOption a is incorrect because not all compound epithelia have a basement membrane. A basement membrane is a thin layer of extracellular matrix that separates the epithelium from the underlying connective tissue. It is present in simple epithelia and some types of stratified epithelia, but not in all compound epithelia.\\n\\nOption b is incorrect because compound epithelia do not necessarily have a germinativum layer of columnar cells. The germinativum layer is a layer of stem cells found in some stratified epithelia, but it is not present in all compound epithelia.\\n\\nOption d is incorrect because compound epithelia do not always have a basal layer of squamous cells. The basal layer of compound epithelia can be composed of different types of cells, such as cuboidal or columnar cells.\",\n","        \"type\": null,\n","        \"is_mandatory\": false,\n","        \"show_in_feed\": false,\n","        \"pyq_label\": null,\n","        \"topic_id\": 146,\n","        \"reading_material_id\": 2087,\n","        \"fixed_at\": null,\n","        \"fix_summary\": null,\n","        \"created_by\": null,\n","        \"updated_by\": null,\n","        \"quiz_level\": null,\n","        \"question_from\": \"Q-bank\",\n","        \"language\": null,\n","        \"photo_url\": null,\n","        \"photo_solution_url\": null,\n","        \"is_saved\": false,\n","        \"tag\": \"\",\n","        \"options\": [\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7646,\n","            \"description\": \"b & c\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1908,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.019+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.019+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7647,\n","            \"description\": \"c only\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1908,\n","            \"is_correct\": true,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.022+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.022+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7648,\n","            \"description\": \"a, b & c\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1908,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.025+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.025+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7649,\n","            \"description\": \"a & c\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1908,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.028+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.028+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          }\n","        ]\n","      },\n","      {\n","        \"id\": 1909,\n","        \"description\": \"Select the correct matching :\",\n","        \"difficulty_level\": null,\n","        \"topic\": \"structural organisation in animals \",\n","        \"is_published\": true,\n","        \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.035+05:30\",\n","        \"updated_at\": \"2024-11-30T18:39:35.427+05:30\",\n","        \"detailed_solution\": \"**Explanation:**\\n\\nEpithelial tissues are the lining or covering tissues of the body.

They are known for their role in allergic reactions, but they also play a role in inflammation and immunity. Mast cells secrete a variety of substances, including:\\n\\n* Histamine: Histamine is a vasodilator, which means it causes blood vessels to widen. This can lead to redness, swelling, and itching.\\n* Tryptase: Tryptase is a protease, which means it breaks down proteins. This can lead to the release of inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines and chemokines.\\n* Chymase: Chymase is another protease that can break down proteins. It can also activate other inflammatory mediators.\\n\\nAll of these substances can contribute to the symptoms of allergic reactions, such as sneezing, runny nose, and watery eyes. Mast cells can also release other substances, such as serotonin and prostaglandins, which can also contribute to inflammation and allergic reactions.\\n\\n**Additional Context:**\\n\\nMast cells are derived from the same stem cells that give rise to basophils. They are found in connective tissue throughout the body, but they are particularly common in the skin, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract. Mast cells are activated by a variety of stimuli, including allergens, cytokines, and physical trauma.\\n\\nWhen mast cells are activated, they degranulate, which means they release the contents of their granules into the extracellular space.

It consists of specialized cells called chondrocytes that are embedded in a matrix composed of collagen fibers, proteoglycans, and water.\\n\\n**Chondroblasts are immature cartilage cells responsible for synthesizing and secreting the matrix.** They are derived from mesenchymal stem cells and differentiate into chondrocytes once they are enclosed within the matrix.\\n\\nDuring the development and growth of cartilage, chondroblasts actively produce and secrete components of the matrix, including collagen fibers, proteoglycans, and other glycosaminoglycans. These molecules form a complex interwoven network that provides the characteristic strength and flexibility of cartilage.\\n\\nThe matrix of cartilage is highly hydrated, containing up to 80% water, which contributes to its resilience and shock-absorbing properties. The collagen fibers provide tensile strength, while proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans bind to water, creating a gel-like substance that allows for compression and flexibility.\\n\\nChondrocytes, once embedded within the matrix, maintain the integrity of the cartilage by producing and secreting additional matrix components as needed. They also regulate the turnover and degradation of the matrix through enzymes such as metalloproteinases.\\n\\n**Other important points related to cartilage matrix production:**\\n\\n* The process of cartilage matrix production is called chondrogenesis.\\n* The composition and properties of the matrix can vary depending on the type of cartilage (hyaline, elastic, or fibrocartilage).\\n* Chondroblasts are often found in clusters called chondrogenic zones or nests.\\n* Once chondroblasts differentiate into chondrocytes, they become trapped within the matrix and lose their ability to divide.\\n* Cartilage is avascular, meaning it lacks blood vessels, which limits its ability to repair and regenerate.\",\n","        \"type\": null,\n","        \"is_mandatory\": false,\n","        \"show_in_feed\": false,\n","        \"pyq_label\": null,\n","        \"topic_id\": 146,\n","        \"reading_material_id\": 2097,\n","        \"fixed_at\": null,\n","        \"fix_summary\": null,\n","        \"created_by\": null,\n","        \"updated_by\": null,\n","        \"quiz_level\": null,\n","        \"question_from\": \"Q-bank\",\n","        \"language\": null,\n","        \"photo_url\": null,\n","        \"photo_solution_url\": null,\n","        \"is_saved\": false,\n","        \"tag\": \"\",\n","        \"options\": [\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7686,\n","            \"description\": \"Chondrocytes\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1918,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.211+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.211+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7687,\n","            \"description\": \"Chondroblasts\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1918,\n","            \"is_correct\": true,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.213+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.213+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7688,\n","            \"description\": \"Osteocytes\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1918,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.216+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.216+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7689,\n","            \"description\": \"Histiocytes\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1918,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.218+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.218+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          }\n","        ]\n","      },\n","      {\n","        \"id\": 1919,\n","        \"description\": \"Which of following lacks blood supply ?\",\n","        \"difficulty_level\": null,\n","        \"topic\": \"structural organisation in animals \",\n","        \"is_published\": true,\n","        \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.225+05:30\",\n","        \"updated_at\": \"2024-11-30T18:39:37.570+05:30\",\n","        \"detailed_solution\": \"**Explanation:**\\n\\nCartilage is a type of connective tissue that is found in various parts of the body, such as the joints, ears, and nose. Unlike other tissues, cartilage does not have a blood supply. Instead, it relies on the diffusion of nutrients from the surrounding tissues.\\n\\nThe lack of blood supply in cartilage is due to its unique structure. Cartilage is composed of cells called chondrocytes, which are embedded in a matrix of collagen and proteoglycans. This matrix is very dense and prevents blood vessels from penetrating the tissue.\\n\\nThe lack of blood supply has several implications for cartilage. First, it means that cartilage is very slow to heal. If cartilage is damaged, it can take a long time for it to repair itself. Second, the lack of blood supply makes cartilage susceptible to infection. Bacteria and other microorganisms cannot easily reach cartilage, but if they do, they can cause serious infections that are difficult to treat.\\n\\n**Additional context:**\\n\\nCartilage is divided into three main types:\\n\\n* **Hyaline cartilage** is the most common type of cartilage. It is found in the joints, the ribs, and the nose.\\n* **Elastic cartilage** is found in the ears and the epiglottis.

Ligaments help to stabilize joints and prevent excessive movement. When a ligament is stretched or torn beyond its normal range of motion, it can cause a sprain.\\n\\n**Additional context:**\\n\\n* Sprains are classified according to their severity:\\n    * Grade 1: Mild stretching of the ligament without tearing\\n    * Grade 2: Partial tearing of the ligament\\n    * Grade 3: Complete tearing of the ligament\\n* Sprains can occur in any joint, but they are most common in the ankle, knee, and wrist.\\n* Symptoms of a sprain include pain, swelling, bruising, and difficulty moving the joint.\\n* Treatment for a sprain typically involves rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE). In some cases, surgery may be necessary to repair a torn ligament.\\n\\n**Relevance to NEET exam:**\\n\\nThe topic of structural organization in animals is an important part of the NEET exam syllabus. Students need to understand the structure and function of different tissues and organs, including ligaments. By understanding the causes and symptoms of sprains, students can better prepare for questions related to this topic on the exam.\",\n","        \"type\": null,\n","        \"is_mandatory\": false,\n","        \"show_in_feed\": false,\n","        \"pyq_label\": null,\n","        \"topic_id\": 146,\n","        \"reading_material_id\": 2099,\n","        \"fixed_at\": null,\n","        \"fix_summary\": null,\n","        \"created_by\": null,\n","        \"updated_by\": null,\n","        \"quiz_level\": null,\n","        \"question_from\": \"Q-bank\",\n","        \"language\": null,\n","        \"photo_url\": null,\n","        \"photo_solution_url\": null,\n","        \"is_saved\": false,\n","        \"tag\": \"\",\n","        \"options\": [\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7694,\n","            \"description\": \"Muscles\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1920,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.260+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.260+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7695,\n","            \"description\": \"Ligaments\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1920,\n","            \"is_correct\": true,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.263+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.263+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7696,\n","            \"description\": \"Tendon\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1920,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.266+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.266+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7697,\n","            \"description\": \"Nerves\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1920,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.269+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.269+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          }\n","        ]\n","      },\n","      {\n","        \"id\": 1921,\n","        \"description\": \"Protein present in cartilage is :\",\n","        \"difficulty_level\": null,\n","        \"topic\": \"structural organisation in animals \",\n","        \"is_published\": true,\n","        \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.276+05:30\",\n","        \"updated_at\": \"2024-11-30T18:39:37.978+05:30\",\n","        \"detailed_solution\": \"**Explanation:**\\n\\nChondrin is a type of collagen that is found in cartilage.

It provides a smooth surface for the bones to move against each other and helps to cushion them from impact. Cartilage is also found in other parts of the body, such as the ears, nose, and trachea.\\n\\n**Additional context:**\\n\\nCartilage is a type of connective tissue that is composed of cells called chondrocytes. Chondrocytes are embedded in a matrix of collagen and proteoglycans. Collagen is a protein that provides strength and flexibility to the cartilage, while proteoglycans are molecules that attract water and give cartilage its cushioning properties.\\n\\nCartilage is avascular, meaning that it does not contain any blood vessels. This means that cartilage cannot repair itself if it is damaged. However, cartilage can be replaced by bone through a process called endochondral ossification. Endochondral ossification is the process by which bones grow in length during childhood.\\n\\n**Uses of cartilage:**\\n\\n* **Provides a smooth surface for bones to move against each other.** Cartilage is found between the ends of bones in joints. It helps to reduce friction and wear and tear on the bones.\\n* **Cushions bones from impact.** Cartilage helps to absorb shock and protect bones from damage.\\n* **Supports and shapes structures.** Cartilage is found in the ears, nose, and trachea. It helps to support these structures and give them their shape.\\n* **Promotes bone growth.** Cartilage is involved in the process of endochondral ossification, which is how bones grow in length during childhood.\",\n","        \"type\": null,\n","        \"is_mandatory\": false,\n","        \"show_in_feed\": false,\n","        \"pyq_label\": null,\n","        \"topic_id\": 146,\n","        \"reading_material_id\": 2103,\n","        \"fixed_at\": null,\n","        \"fix_summary\": null,\n","        \"created_by\": null,\n","        \"updated_by\": null,\n","        \"quiz_level\": null,\n","        \"question_from\": \"Q-bank\",\n","        \"language\": null,\n","        \"photo_url\": null,\n","        \"photo_solution_url\": null,\n","        \"is_saved\": false,\n","        \"tag\": \"\",\n","        \"options\": [\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7710,\n","            \"description\": \"Between adjacent bones of vertebral column and limbs\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1924,\n","            \"is_correct\": true,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.346+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.346+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7711,\n","            \"description\": \"In middle of the long bone\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1924,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.348+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.348+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7712,\n","            \"description\": \"Bone marrow cavity\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1924,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.351+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.351+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7713,\n","            \"description\": \"All of the above\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1924,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.353+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.353+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          }\n","        ]\n","      },\n","      {\n","        \"id\": 1925,\n","        \"description\": \"Regeneration of cartilage can occur from its :\",\n","        \"difficulty_level\": null,\n","        \"topic\": \"structural organisation in animals \",\n","        \"is_published\": true,\n","        \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.361+05:30\",\n","        \"updated_at\": \"2024-11-30T18:39:38.773+05:30\",\n","        \"detailed_solution\": \"**Explanation:**\\nCartilage is a connective tissue that is found in many parts of the body, including the joints, ears, and nose.

They are responsible for providing stability and preventing excessive movement at joints.\\n\\nIf ligaments are cut or broken, the bones they connect will become unfixed. This can lead to instability, pain, and decreased range of motion at the affected joint.\\n\\nIn severe cases, a torn ligament can lead to dislocation of the bones, which is a complete separation of the bones at a joint. This can be a very serious injury that requires immediate medical attention.\\n\\nTherefore, it is important to protect ligaments from injury by avoiding activities that could put them at risk, such as contact sports or heavy lifting. If you do experience a ligament injury, it is important to see a doctor to get it diagnosed and treated properly.\\n\\n**Additional context**\\nThe structural organization of animals is a fundamental concept in biology that refers to the way in which the different parts of an animal's body are organized and arranged. Ligaments are just one type of connective tissue that is found in the body. Other types of connective tissue include tendons, cartilage, and bone. Each type of connective tissue has a specific structure and function.\\n\\n**Relevance to NEET Exam**\\nThe NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test) is a highly competitive entrance exam that is used to select students for admission to medical schools in India. The exam covers a wide range of topics, including biology, chemistry, and physics. The question about ligaments is relevant to the NEET exam because it tests a student's understanding of the structural organization of animals.\",\n","        \"type\": null,\n","

It is composed of cells called chondroblasts, which are responsible for producing the cartilage matrix. The matrix is made up of collagen fibers and proteoglycans, which give cartilage its strength and flexibility.\\n\\nChondroblasts are found in the inner layer of the perichondrium, which is a membrane that surrounds cartilage. When a chondroblast produces enough matrix, it becomes trapped within the matrix and is called a chondrocyte. Chondrocytes are mature cartilage cells that are responsible for maintaining the cartilage matrix.\\n\\nThere are three types of cartilage: hyaline cartilage, elastic cartilage, and fibrocartilage. Hyaline cartilage is the most common type of cartilage and is found in the joints, ribs, and trachea. Elastic cartilage is found in the ears and epiglottis and is more flexible than hyaline cartilage. Fibrocartilage is found in the intervertebral discs and knee menisci and is stronger than hyaline cartilage.\\n\\nCartilage is an important tissue that plays a role in many functions of the body. It provides support and cushioning for the joints, allows for movement, and helps to protect the body from injury.\",\n","        \"type\": null,\n","        \"is_mandatory\": false,\n","        \"show_in_feed\": false,\n","        \"pyq_label\": null,\n","        \"topic_id\": 146,\n","        \"reading_material_id\": 2108,\n","        \"fixed_at\": null,\n","        \"fix_summary\": null,\n","        \"created_by\": null,\n","        \"updated_by\": null,\n","        \"quiz_level\": null,\n","        \"question_from\": \"Q-bank\",\n","        \"language\": null,\n","        \"photo_url\": null,\n","        \"photo_solution_url\": null,\n","        \"is_saved\": false,\n","        \"tag\": \"\",\n","        \"options\": [\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7730,\n","            \"description\": \"Osteoblasts\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1929,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.487+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.487+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7731,\n","            \"description\": \"Fibroblasts\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1929,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.490+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.490+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7732,\n","            \"description\": \"Chondroclasts\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1929,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.493+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.493+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7733,\n","            \"description\": \"Chondroblasts\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1929,\n","            \"is_correct\": true,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.497+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.497+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          }\n","        ]\n","      },\n","      {\n","        \"id\": 1930,\n","        \"description\": \"The membrane that covers cartilage is known as :\",\n","        \"difficulty_level\": null,\n","        \"topic\": \"structural organisation in animals \",\n","        \"is_published\": true,\n","        \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.507+05:30\",\n","        \"updated_at\": \"2024-11-30T18:39:39.781+05:30\",\n","        \"detailed_solution\": \"**Explanation:**\\n\\n**Cartilage** is a type of connective tissue that provides structural support to the body.

Cartilage is a type of connective tissue that is found in many parts of the body, including the ears, nose, and joints. It is a strong and flexible tissue that provides support and protection to the structures it encloses.\\n\\nThe pinna is made up of a thin layer of skin that covers a framework of cartilage. The cartilage is arranged in a complex shape that helps to collect and funnel sound waves into the ear canal. The shape of the pinna also helps to determine the direction from which sound is coming.\\n\\nThe cartilage of the pinna is elastic, which allows it to withstand bending and twisting forces. This flexibility helps to protect the delicate structures of the inner ear from damage.\\n\\n**Additional Context:**\\n\\nThe external ear is the only visible part of the ear. It is located on the side of the head and is connected to the skull by a short, bony canal called the ear canal. The ear canal leads to the middle ear, which is an air-filled cavity that contains the eardrum and the ossicles (three small bones that transmit sound waves to the inner ear). The inner ear is located deep within the skull and contains the cochlea and the vestibular system, which are responsible for hearing and balance, respectively.\",\n","        \"type\": null,\n","        \"is_mandatory\": false,\n","        \"show_in_feed\": false,\n","        \"pyq_label\": null,\n","        \"topic_id\": 146,\n","        \"reading_material_id\": 2110,\n","        \"fixed_at\": null,\n","        \"fix_summary\": null,\n","        \"created_by\": null,\n","        \"updated_by\": null,\n","        \"quiz_level\": null,\n","        \"question_from\": \"Q-bank\",\n","        \"language\": null,\n","        \"photo_url\": null,\n","        \"photo_solution_url\": null,\n","        \"is_saved\": false,\n","        \"tag\": \"\",\n","        \"options\": [\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7738,\n","            \"description\": \"Bone\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1931,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.541+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.541+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7739,\n","            \"description\": \"Cartilage\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1931,\n","            \"is_correct\": true,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.545+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.545+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7740,\n","            \"description\": \"Tendon\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1931,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.550+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.550+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7741,\n","            \"description\": \"Ligament\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1931,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.555+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.555+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          }\n","        ]\n","      },\n","      {\n","        \"id\": 1932,\n","        \"description\": \"Formation of cartilage is known as :\",\n","        \"difficulty_level\": null,\n","        \"topic\": \"structural organisation in animals \",\n","        \"is_published\": true,\n","        \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.563+05:30\",\n","        \"updated_at\": \"2024-11-30T18:39:40.183+05:30\",\n","        \"detailed_solution\": \"**Explanation:**\\n\\nChondrogenesis is the process by which cartilage is formed.

 \"detailed_solution\": \"**Cardiac muscle fibres are striated and involuntary.**\\n\\n* **Striated:** Cardiac muscle cells have a striated appearance due to the arrangement of thick and thin filaments within the cell. This striated appearance is similar to that seen in skeletal muscle cells.\\n* **Involuntary:** Cardiac muscle cells are involuntary, meaning that they contract automatically without conscious control. This is in contrast to skeletal muscle cells, which are voluntary and can be controlled consciously.\\n\\nThe striated appearance of cardiac muscle cells is due to the arrangement of thick and thin filaments within the cell. The thick filaments are composed of the protein myosin, while the thin filaments are composed of the proteins actin and tropomyosin. The arrangement of these filaments allows for the sliding filament mechanism of muscle contraction, which is responsible for the contraction of the heart muscle.\\n\\nThe involuntary nature of cardiac muscle cells is due to the presence of pacemaker cells in the heart. Pacemaker cells are specialized cells that generate electrical impulses that cause the heart muscle to contract. These impulses are generated automatically, without conscious control, and they ensure that the heart muscle continues to contract rhythmically throughout the life of the organism.\",\n","        \"type\": null,\n","        \"is_mandatory\": false,\n","        \"show_in_feed\": false,\n","        \"pyq_label\": null,\n","        \"topic_id\": 146,\n","        \"reading_material_id\": 2115,\n","        \"fixed_at\": null,\n","        \"fix_summary\": null,\n","        \"created_by\": null,\n","        \"updated_by\": null,\n","        \"quiz_level\": null,\n","        \"question_from\": \"Q-bank\",\n","        \"language\": null,\n","        \"photo_url\": null,\n","        \"photo_solution_url\": null,\n","        \"is_saved\": false,\n","        \"tag\": \"\",\n","        \"options\": [\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7758,\n","            \"description\": \"Striated and involuntary\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1936,\n","            \"is_correct\": true,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.680+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.680+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7759,\n","            \"description\": \"Striated and voluntary\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1936,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.686+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.686+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7760,\n","            \"description\": \"Non\\u2013striated and involuntary\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1936,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.696+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.696+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7761,\n","            \"description\": \"Non\\u2013striated and voluntary\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1936,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.700+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.700+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          }\n","        ]\n","      },\n","      {\n","        \"id\": 1937,\n","        \"description\": \"Which one of the following muscles, gets fatigued very quickly?\",\n","        \"difficulty_level\": null,\n","        \"topic\": \"structural organisation in animals \",\n","        \"is_published\": true,\n","        \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.716+05:30\",\n","        \"updated_at\": \"2024-11-30T18:39:41.197+05:30\",\n","        \"detailed_solution\": \"**Explanation:**\\n\\nSkeletal muscles are voluntary muscles that are attached to the bones.

This process, known as saltatory conduction, makes the transmission of electrical signals much faster than if the signal had to travel through the entire length of the myelin sheath.\\n\\n**Additional context:**\\n\\n* The Nodes of Ranvier are named after the French physiologist Louis-Antoine Ranvier, who first described them in 1878.\\n* The Nodes of Ranvier are found in both myelinated and unmyelinated axons, but they are more common in myelinated axons.\\n* The distance between the Nodes of Ranvier is typically about 1 millimeter.\\n* The Nodes of Ranvier play an important role in the transmission of electrical signals along the axon. They help to speed up the signal and prevent it from being lost in the myelin sheath.\\n\\n**Usefulness for a student:**\\n\\nThis information can be used by a student to answer similar questions on the NEET exam. For example, a student may be asked to identify the location of the Nodes of Ranvier or to explain how they help to speed up the transmission of electrical signals along the axon.\",\n","        \"type\": null,\n","        \"is_mandatory\": false,\n","        \"show_in_feed\": false,\n","        \"pyq_label\": null,\n","        \"topic_id\": 146,\n","        \"reading_material_id\": 2119,\n","        \"fixed_at\": null,\n","        \"fix_summary\": null,\n","        \"created_by\": null,\n","        \"updated_by\": null,\n","        \"quiz_level\": null,\n","        \"question_from\": \"Q-bank\",\n","        \"language\": null,\n","        \"photo_url\": null,\n","        \"photo_solution_url\": null,\n","        \"is_saved\": false,\n","        \"tag\": \"\",\n","        \"options\": [\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7774,\n","            \"description\": \"Cyton\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1940,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.840+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.840+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7775,\n","            \"description\": \"Dendrons\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1940,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.848+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.848+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7776,\n","            \"description\": \"Axon\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1940,\n","            \"is_correct\": true,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.853+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.853+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7777,\n","            \"description\": \"Astrocyte\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1940,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.855+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.855+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          }\n","        ]\n","      },\n","      {\n","        \"id\": 1941,\n","        \"description\": \"Which cell-organelle is absent in neurons ?\",\n","        \"difficulty_level\": null,\n","        \"topic\": \"structural organisation in animals \",\n","        \"is_published\": true,\n","        \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:46.864+05:30\",\n","        \"updated_at\": \"2024-11-30T18:39:42.032+05:30\",\n","        \"detailed_solution\": \"**Answer: Centriole**\\n\\n**Explanation:**\\n\\nCentrioles are cylindrical structures that help in organizing microtubules for the formation of cilia and flagella. They are present in almost all eukaryotic cells, except for mature red blood cells and neural cells like neurons.\\n\\nIn neurons, the absence of centrioles is related to their unique function and structure. Neurons are primarily responsible for transmitting electrical impulses, and their shape and structure are optimized for this purpose. The presence of centrioles, which are involved in cell division, would not be beneficial for neurons as they do not undergo cell division once they mature.\\n\\nThe absence of centrioles in neurons is a specialized adaptation that allows them to maintain their structure and function effectively throughout their lifespan.\",\n","        \"type\": null,\n","        \"is_mandatory\": false,\n","

Therefore, neurons cannot be grown by tissue culture methods.\\n\\n**Additional Context:**\\n\\n* Tissue culture is a valuable tool for studying cell growth, differentiation, and metabolism.\\n* It is used in various applications, including research, medical diagnostics, and biotechnology.\\n* Other cells that cannot be grown by tissue culture include red blood cells, skeletal muscle cells, and lens cells.\",\n","        \"type\": null,\n","        \"is_mandatory\": false,\n","        \"show_in_feed\": false,\n","        \"pyq_label\": null,\n","        \"topic_id\": 146,\n","        \"reading_material_id\": 2126,\n","        \"fixed_at\": null,\n","        \"fix_summary\": null,\n","        \"created_by\": null,\n","        \"updated_by\": null,\n","        \"quiz_level\": null,\n","        \"question_from\": \"Q-bank\",\n","        \"language\": null,\n","        \"photo_url\": null,\n","        \"photo_solution_url\": null,\n","        \"is_saved\": false,\n","        \"tag\": \"\",\n","        \"options\": [\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7802,\n","            \"description\": \"Epithelial cell\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1947,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:47.028+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:47.028+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7803,\n","            \"description\": \"Fibroblast\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1947,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:47.032+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:47.032+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7804,\n","            \"description\": \"Monocyte\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1947,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:47.035+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:47.035+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7805,\n","            \"description\": \"Neuron\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1947,\n","            \"is_correct\": true,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:47.042+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:47.042+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          }\n","        ]\n","      },\n","      {\n","        \"id\": 1948,\n","        \"description\": \"Which one of the following types of cell is involved in making of the inner walls of blood vessels?\",\n","        \"difficulty_level\": null,\n","        \"topic\": \"structural organisation in animals \",\n","        \"is_published\": true,\n","        \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:47.056+05:30\",\n","        \"updated_at\": \"2024-11-30T18:39:43.479+05:30\",\n","        \"detailed_solution\": \"**Explanation**\\n\\nThe inner walls of blood vessels are lined by **squamous epithelium**.

They are responsible for the contraction and relaxation of muscles, which allows for movement.\\n\\nThere are three types of muscle fibres: skeletal muscle fibres, cardiac muscle fibres, and smooth muscle fibres.\\n\\n* **Skeletal muscle fibres** are attached to bones and are responsible for voluntary movements, such as walking, running, and jumping. They are long, cylindrical cells with striations (bands) that are visible under a microscope.\\n* **Cardiac muscle fibres** are found in the heart and are responsible for the pumping action of the heart. They are also long, cylindrical cells with striations, but they are shorter and thicker than skeletal muscle fibres.\\n* **Smooth muscle fibres** are found in the walls of hollow organs, such as the stomach, intestines, and blood vessels. They are not attached to bones and are responsible for involuntary movements, such as digestion and blood flow. They are shorter and thinner than skeletal muscle fibres and do not have striations.\\n\\n**Therefore, the muscle fibre that tapers at ends and does not show striations is a smooth muscle fibre.**\\n\\n**Additional context:**\\n\\nMuscle fibres are composed of myofibrils, which are bundles of myofilaments. Myofilaments are made up of two proteins: actin and myosin. When a muscle fibre contracts, the myosin filaments slide over the actin filaments, causing the muscle to shorten.\\n\\nThe striations in skeletal and cardiac muscle fibres are caused by the arrangement of the actin and myosin filaments. In skeletal muscle fibres, the actin and myosin filaments are arranged in a regular pattern, which creates the striated appearance. In cardiac muscle fibres, the actin and myosin filaments are arranged in a less regular pattern, which creates a less distinct striated appearance.\\n\\nSmooth muscle fibres do not have striations because the actin and myosin filaments are not arranged in a regular pattern.\",\n","        \"type\": null,\n","        \"is_mandatory\": false,\n","        \"show_in_feed\": false,\n","        \"pyq_label\": null,\n","        \"topic_id\": 146,\n","        \"reading_material_id\": 2131,\n","        \"fixed_at\": null,\n","        \"fix_summary\": null,\n","        \"created_by\": null,\n","        \"updated_by\": null,\n","        \"quiz_level\": null,\n","        \"question_from\": \"Q-bank\",\n","        \"language\": null,\n","        \"photo_url\": null,\n","        \"photo_solution_url\": null,\n","        \"is_saved\": false,\n","        \"tag\": \"\",\n","        \"options\": [\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7822,\n","            \"description\": \"Smooth muscle fibre\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1952,\n","            \"is_correct\": true,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:47.169+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:47.169+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7823,\n","            \"description\": \"Skeletal muscle fibre\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1952,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:47.178+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:47.178+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7824,\n","            \"description\": \"Cardiac muscle fibre\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1952,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:47.181+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:47.181+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7825,\n","            \"description\": \"Striated muscle fibre\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1952,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:47.183+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:47.183+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          }\n","        ]\n","      },\n","      {\n","        \"id\": 1953,\n","        \"description\": \"Structural organisation in animals attains different levels as cell\\u2013organ\\u2013organ system.

Over time, most of the body's tissues break down, including the blood vessels. However, the arteries of many mummies remain intact due to the presence of well preserved elastic fibres.\\n\\nElastic fibres are a type of connective tissue that is highly flexible and elastic. They are found in the walls of arteries and help to prevent them from collapsing when blood pressure drops. In mummies, the elastic fibres have been preserved due to the embalming process, which involved the use of chemicals that prevent the breakdown of tissues.

The inorganic component, which makes up about 70% of the matrix, is primarily composed of hydroxyapatite crystals. These crystals give bone its strength and hardness. The organic component, which makes up about 30% of the matrix, is composed of collagen fibers. These fibers provide bone with its flexibility and tensile strength.\\n\\n**Additional Context:**\\n\\n* Hydroxyapatite crystals are arranged in a lattice structure that gives bone its characteristic strength and hardness.\\n* Collagen fibers are arranged in a network that gives bone its flexibility and tensile strength.\\n* The ratio of inorganic to organic components in bone varies depending on the age and health of the individual.\\n* Bone is constantly being remodeled, with new bone being laid down and old bone being resorbed. This process helps to maintain the strength and integrity of bone.\",\n","        \"type\": null,\n","        \"is_mandatory\": false,\n","        \"show_in_feed\": false,\n","        \"pyq_label\": null,\n","        \"topic_id\": 146,\n","        \"reading_material_id\": 2143,\n","        \"fixed_at\": null,\n","        \"fix_summary\": null,\n","        \"created_by\": null,\n","        \"updated_by\": null,\n","        \"quiz_level\": null,\n","        \"question_from\": \"Q-bank\",\n","        \"language\": null,\n","        \"photo_url\": null,\n","        \"photo_solution_url\": null,\n","        \"is_saved\": false,\n","        \"tag\": \"\",\n","        \"options\": [\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7870,\n","            \"description\": \"40% inorganic, 60% organic\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1964,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:47.455+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:47.455+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7871,\n","            \"description\": \"62% inorganic, 38% organic\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1964,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:47.461+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:47.461+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7872,\n","            \"description\": \"70% inorganic, 30% organic\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1964,\n","            \"is_correct\": true,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:47.465+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:47.465+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          },\n","          {\n","            \"id\": 7873,\n","            \"description\": \"85% inorganic, 15% organic\",\n","            \"question_id\": 1964,\n","            \"is_correct\": false,\n","            \"created_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:47.467+05:30\",\n","            \"updated_at\": \"2024-07-02T17:11:47.467+05:30\",\n","            \"unanswered\": false,\n","            \"photo_url\": null\n","          }\n","        ]\n","      }\n","    ]\n","  }\n","}\n"]}],"source":["import json\n","\n","# Print structure of student responses data\n","print(json.dumps(student_responses_data, indent=2))\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":98,"status":"ok","timestamp":1739023920646,"user":{"displayName":"ananyaa arun","userId":"05848330046977443795"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"z88R49BWnFSY","outputId":"2b3c07c5-65bf-4c81-aef6-e85d61c20d90"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Quiz DataFrame:\n","   id  name                                              title description  \\\n","0  43  None  Structural Organisation in Animals and Plants (7)               \n","\n","  difficulty_level                               topic  \\\n","0             None  Structural Organisation in Animals   \n","\n","                            time  is_published                     created_at  \\\n","0  2024-07-03T00:00:00.000+05:30          True  2024-07-03T11:00:08.958+05:30   \n","\n","                      updated_at  ...  exam_id show_unanswered     ends_at  \\\n","0  2024-09-23T18:43:27.751+05:30  ...

This free surface may face either a body fluid (such as blood, lymph, or mucus) or the outside environment.\\n\\n**Characteristics of Epithelial Tissue:**\\n\\n* **Free Surface:** The cells have an exposed surface that faces either a body fluid or the external environment.\\n* **Apical Surface:** The surface facing the external environment or body cavity.\\n* **Basal Surface:** The surface attached to the connective tissue below.\\n* **Closely Packed:** The cells are closely packed together with minimal intercellular space.\\n* **Polarized Cells:** They are generally polarized, with different apical and basal surfaces and functions.\\n* **Basement Membrane:** The basal surface is supported by a basement membrane, which separates the epithelium from the underlying connective tissue.\\n* **Avascular:** Epithelial cells are avascular, meaning they lack blood vessels. They receive nutrients from the underlying connective tissue through diffusion.\\n\\n**Functions of Epithelial Tissue:**\\n\\n* **Protection:** Forms a physical barrier against pathogens, chemicals, and physical damage.\\n* **Secretion:** Secretes various substances, such as mucus, enzymes, and hormones.\\n* **Absorption:** Facilitates the uptake of substances from the external environment or body fluids.\\n* **Excretion:** Helps eliminate waste products from the body.\\n* **Sensory:** Contains specialized cells that detect changes in the environment and transmit sensory information.\\n\\n**Additional Context:**\\n\\nEpithelial tissue is classified into different types based on its structure and function. Some of the common types include:\\n\\n* **Simple Epithelium:** Consists of a single layer of cells.\\n* **Stratified Epithelium:** Consists of multiple layers of cells.\\n* **Glandular Epithelium:** Specialized for secretion of substances.\\n* **Sensory Epithelium:** Contains specialized sensory cells.\",\n","    \"type\": \"\",\n","    \"is_mandatory\": false,\n","    \"show_in_feed\":

They are associated with **areolar connective tissue**, which is a loose, irregularly arranged type of connective tissue that is found in many parts of the body, such as the dermis of the skin and the submucosa of the digestive tract. Mast cells are important for the body's immune response, as they release histamine and other inflammatory mediators when they are activated.\\n\\nHere are some additional details about mast cells and areolar connective tissue:\\n\\n* Mast cells are derived from stem cells in the bone marrow. They circulate in the blood and then migrate to tissues where they are needed.\\n* Areolar connective tissue is a type of loose connective tissue that is characterized by its loose, irregular arrangement of collagen fibers. It is found in many parts of the body, such as the dermis of the skin, the submucosa of the digestive tract, and the stroma of organs.\\n* Mast cells are activated by a variety of stimuli, including allergens, cytokines, and physical trauma. When they are activated, they release histamine and other inflammatory mediators, which cause blood vessels to dilate and become more permeable. This leads to increased blood flow and the accumulation of fluid and white blood cells in the affected area.\\n* Mast cells play an important role in the body's immune response. They are involved in both innate immunity and adaptive immunity. In innate immunity, mast cells release histamine and other inflammatory mediators that help to recruit other immune cells to the site of infection. In adaptive immunity, mast cells present antigens to T cells, which helps to activate the adaptive immune response.\\n\\nOverall, mast cells are important cells that play a key role in the body's immune response.

Unlike other tissues, cartilage does not have a blood supply. Instead, it relies on the diffusion of nutrients from the surrounding tissues.\\n\\nThe lack of blood supply in cartilage is due to its unique structure. Cartilage is composed of cells called chondrocytes, which are embedded in a matrix of collagen and proteoglycans. This matrix is very dense and prevents blood vessels from penetrating the tissue.\\n\\nThe lack of blood supply has several implications for cartilage. First, it means that cartilage is very slow to heal. If cartilage is damaged, it can take a long time for it to repair itself. Second, the lack of blood supply makes cartilage susceptible to infection. Bacteria and other microorganisms cannot easily reach cartilage, but if they do, they can cause serious infections that are difficult to treat.\\n\\n**Additional context:**\\n\\nCartilage is divided into three main types:\\n\\n* **Hyaline cartilage** is the most common type of cartilage. It is found in the joints, the ribs, and the nose.\\n* **Elastic cartilage** is found in the ears and the epiglottis.

They are responsible for providing stability and preventing excessive movement at joints.\\n\\nIf ligaments are cut or broken, the bones they connect will become unfixed. This can lead to instability, pain, and decreased range of motion at the affected joint.\\n\\nIn severe cases, a torn ligament can lead to dislocation of the bones, which is a complete separation of the bones at a joint. This can be a very serious injury that requires immediate medical attention.\\n\\nTherefore, it is important to protect ligaments from injury by avoiding activities that could put them at risk, such as contact sports or heavy lifting. If you do experience a ligament injury, it is important to see a doctor to get it diagnosed and treated properly.\\n\\n**Additional context**\\nThe structural organization of animals is a fundamental concept in biology that refers to the way in which the different parts of an animal's body are organized and arranged.

It is composed of cells called chondroblasts, which are responsible for producing the cartilage matrix. The matrix is made up of collagen fibers and proteoglycans, which give cartilage its strength and flexibility.\\n\\nChondroblasts are found in the inner layer of the perichondrium, which is a membrane that surrounds cartilage. When a chondroblast produces enough matrix, it becomes trapped within the matrix and is called a chondrocyte. Chondrocytes are mature cartilage cells that are responsible for maintaining the cartilage matrix.\\n\\nThere are three types of cartilage: hyaline cartilage, elastic cartilage, and fibrocartilage. Hyaline cartilage is the most common type of cartilage and is found in the joints, ribs, and trachea. Elastic cartilage is found in the ears and epiglottis and is more flexible than hyaline cartilage. Fibrocartilage is found in the intervertebral discs and knee menisci and is stronger than hyaline cartilage.\\n\\nCartilage is an important tissue that plays a role in many functions of the body.

This process helps to maintain the strength and integrity of bone.', 'type': None, 'is_mandatory': False, 'show_in_feed': False, 'pyq_label': None, 'topic_id': 146, 'reading_material_id': 2143, 'fixed_at': None, 'fix_summary': None, 'created_by': None, 'updated_by': None, 'quiz_level': None, 'question_from': 'Q-bank', 'language': None, 'photo_url': None, 'photo_solution_url': None, 'is_saved': False, 'tag': '', 'options': [{'id': 7870, 'description': '40% inorganic, 60% organic', 'question_id': 1964, 'is_correct': False, 'created_at': '2024-07-02T17:11:47.455+05:30', 'updated_at': '2024-07-02T17:11:47.455+05:30', 'unanswered': False, 'photo_url': None}, {'id': 7871, 'description': '62% inorganic, 38% organic', 'question_id': 1964, 'is_correct': False, 'created_at': '2024-07-02T17:11:47.461+05:30', 'updated_at': '2024-07-02T17:11:47.461+05:30', 'unanswered': False, 'photo_url': None}, {'id': 7872, 'description': '70% inorganic, 30% organic', 'question_id': 1964, 'is_correct': True, 'created_at': '2024-07-02T17:11:47.465+05:30', 'updated_at': '2024-07-02T17:11:47.465+05:30', 'unanswered': False, 'photo_url': None}, {'id': 7873, 'description': '85% inorganic, 15% organic', 'question_id': 1964, 'is_correct': False, 'created_at': '2024-07-02T17:11:47.467+05:30', 'updated_at': '2024-07-02T17:11:47.467+05:30', 'unanswered': False, 'photo_url': None}]}]}}\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import files\n","uploaded = files.upload()  # This will prompt you to upload files\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":142},"id":"OpndJrhaazgY","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1739113054564,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":38414,"user":{"displayName":"ananyaa arun","userId":"05848330046977443795"}},"outputId":"51c6c25b-8b9e-406b-e66b-a80a9f01d515"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"],"text/html":["\n","     <input type=\"file\" id=\"files-f2edad10-5344-419d-a255-104722d04226\" name=\"files[]\" multiple disabled\n","        style=\"border:none\" />\n","     <output id=\"result-f2edad10-5344-419d-a255-104722d04226\">\n","      Upload widget is only available when the cell has been executed in the\n","      current browser session.
